        <h1>How to Contribute to DePress</h1>
    </div>

    <h2>Developers</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Setup your KNIME as described in <a href="#/quiuckstart">Quickstart</a></li>
        <li>Download dev branch from GitHub repository. Decompress it if necessary.</li>
        <li>Run <i>eclipse.exe</i></li>
        <li>Choose <i>File</i> -> <i>Import</i> and then in <i>General section</i>, choose <i>Existing Projects into
            Workspace</i>. Click <i>Next</i>.
        </li>
        <li>In next step, in <i>Select root directory</i> choose the directory of your git cloned repository. Numerous
            projects should appear in a box under the name of chosen directory.
            Select them all, select <i>Copy projects into workspace</i>, under the list and click <i>Finish</i>.
        </li>
        <li>Now you have to compile it. To do so, right-click on any of imported projects seen on the right (eg.
            ic-depress-examples) and choose <i>Run As</i> -> <i>Eclipse Application</i>. (The same thing you can do by
            clicking the button on the top with a white arrow in a green circle.)
        </li>
        <li>New eclipse instance should execute with all DePress plugins loaded. Open KNIME Perspective.</li>
        <li>In the new instance, you should be able to find DePress plugins in <i>Node Repository</i> window(if you can
            not find this window, the link in the third point of KNIME instruction can be useful).
        </li>
        <li>Now you are ready to create KNIME Workflow. Right-click on <i>Local(Local Workspace)</i> in KNIME Explorer
            window. Choose <i>New KNIME Workflow</i>. Type the name of your workflow and you can start using plugins.
        </li>
        <li>In the directory with KNIME application you can find an useful document called <i>Quickstart</i>. There is a
            lot of information about starting work with as well KNIME as plugins. We recommend checking it out.
        </li>
    </ol>

            your changes in the GitHub application, please check if you are still on the <i>dev</i> branch.
        </li>
        <li>To add changes to the main DePress repository, visit your GitHub page and click <i>Pull Request</i>. Do not
            do it after each change. Do it after completing your whole task.
