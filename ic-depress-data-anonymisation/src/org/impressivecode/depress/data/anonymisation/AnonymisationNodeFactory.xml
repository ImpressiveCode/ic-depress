        Encrypts and decrypts selected columns from input data set using DES cryptographic algorithm.
    </shortDescription>    
    <fullDescription>
        <intro>Selected columns from input data set, which are plain text, will be encrypted. 
        Selected columns from input data set, which are already encrypted, will be decrypted.
        The same cryptographic key has to be used for encryption and decryption process, because of symmetric cipher algorithm usage (DES).
        Potentially encrypted columns from input data set are marked, so they can be distinguished from plain text columns.
        Output data set has the same structure as input data set - only difference is, that selected columns are encrypted or decrypted.
