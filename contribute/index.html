    </div>

    <h2>Developers</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Setup your KNIME as described in <a href="#/quiuckstart">Quickstart</a></li>
        <li>Download dev branch from GitHub repository. Decompress it if necessary.</li>
        <li>Run <i>eclipse.exe</i></li>
        <li>Choose <i>File</i> -> <i>Import</i> and then in <i>Plug-in Development section</i>, choose <i>Plug-ins and Fragments
            </i>. Click <i>Next</i>.
        </li>
        <li>In next step, in:
            <ul>
                <li><i>Import From</i> select <i>Directory</i> and choose the directory of your git cloned repository.</li>
                <li><i>Plug-ins and Fragments to Import</i> select <i>Import plug-ins and fragments required by existing
                    workspace plug-ins</i>
                </li>
                <li><i>Import As</i> select <i>Projects with source folders</i></li>
            </ul>
            Click <i>Next</i>.
        </li>
        <li>Numerous projects should appear. Select them all, and click  <i>Finish</i>.</li>
        <li>Now you have to compile it. To do so, right-click on any of imported projects seen on the right (eg.
            ic-depress-examples) and choose <i>Run As</i> -> <i>Eclipse Application</i>. (The same thing you can do by
            clicking the button on the top with a white arrow in a green circle.)
        </li>
        <li>New eclipse instance should execute with all DePress plugins loaded. Open KNIME Perspective.</li>
        <li>In the new instance, you should be able to find DePress plugins in <i>Node Repository</i> window(if you can
            not find this window, the link in the third point of KNIME instruction can be useful).
        </li>
        <li>Now you are ready to create KNIME Workflow. Right-click on <i>Local(Local Workspace)</i> in KNIME Explorer
            window. Choose <i>New KNIME Workflow</i>. Type the name of your workflow and you can start using plugins.
        </li>
        <li>In the directory with KNIME application you can find an useful document called <i>Quickstart</i>. There is a
            lot of information about starting work with as well KNIME as plugins. We recommend checking it out.
        </li>
