		<intro>
			This node can be used to read data from Jira entries file.

			<p>
				Jira is defect tracking software, developed by
				<a href="http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/">Atlassian</a>
				. It uses web-based user interface,
				which allows gathering all
				previously registered software defects,
				filtering them using custom
				settings and export in various formats,
				also in XML format which is
				required for using this node.
				<br />
				To obtain such file, you need to switch view to XML in Issue
				Navigator section of Jira, and save the XML shown to a file on your
				local disk.
				Then enter path to the file into node’s input field in
				configuration
				dialog.
				<br />
				When executed, Jira Adapter node parses the file and return
				information collected in standard table form. When some of the
				required information is missing,
				for example due to Jira
				customization, node will generate appropriate
				warning message in the
				console.
