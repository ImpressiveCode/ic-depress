		<intro>
			This node can be used to read data from Jira entries file.

			<p>
            Jira is defect tracking software, developed by <a href="http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/">Atlassian</a>. It uses web-based user interface, 
			which allows gathering all previously registered software defects, filtering them using custom settings and export in various formats, 
			also in XML format which is required for using this node.<br/>
			To obtain such file, you need to switch view to XML in Issue Navigator section of Jira, and save the XML shown to a file on your local disk. 
			Then enter path to the file into nodeâ€™s input field in configuration dialog.<br/>
			When executed, Jira Adapter node parses the file and return information collected in standard table form. When some of the required information is missing, 
			for example due to Jira customization, node will generate appropriate warning message in the console.
